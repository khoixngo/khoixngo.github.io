        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Khoi Ngo’s sociological research is guided by fundamental questions about the degree to which certain groups are systematically disadvantaged by institutions of social control and how said groups internalize or subvert such marginalization. His interests span race &amp; ethnicity, social control (policing &amp; incarceration), social movements, and stratification. For his doctoral work, he will examine racial profiling in policing, the collective as well as everyday responses of racial minorities, and the evolving interactions between state agencies and their subjects.
